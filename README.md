# Design and Development of an Experimental Microgrid Laboratory with Modular Power Electronics Structures and Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop Environment ⚡🏙️

## What will you find in this repository? 🔋🔬

_This repository contains all materials related to the development of the **Experimental Microgrid Laboratory**, designed as a modular platform for validating power converters and control strategies under hybrid environments (simulation, emulation, and real hardware testing)._

_The project integrates modular **Power Electronics Building Blocks (PEBBs)** with the **Typhoon HIL 604** platform for **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** and **Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL)** testing, enabling the analysis of DC-DC and DC-AC converters, renewable energy coupling, energy storage systems, and programmable loads under controlled conditions._

_This work was carried out by **Julian Ontibon** as part of his Master’s thesis in Electrical Engineering at the **Universidad de los Andes**, aiming to create a **replicable research infrastructure** for progressive validation of microgrid systems and converter technologies._
