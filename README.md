ChatGPT said:  This thesis develops a modular experimental microgrid laboratory to validate power converters and control in real and emulated environments. Modular PEBBs integrated with Typhoon HIL enable HIL/PHIL testing, assessing hardware, protection, and gfm/gfl modes, supporting research, training, and replicable microgrid development.
